Write an array called prog_languages that has three objects. The objects should keep three properties (name: string, founder: object, founded: year). The founder property is also an object that stores the name and e-mail values of the founder (these don't have to be real values, you can make them up... or Google them).  

Output the whole array in the console
In another line, output only the first item in the array
In another line, output the e-mail of the founder of the second item in the array
Add one item (object) to the beginning of the array
Add one item (object) to the end of the array
Output the changes
